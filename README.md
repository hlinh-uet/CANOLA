# CANOLA: Noise-Aware Framework for Correcting Corrupted Labels

## Introduction
We introduce **CANOLA**, a novel framework for robust and stable corrupted label correction. 
Motivated by the strong generalization capability of DNNs, CANOLA rethinks *when* and *how* label correction signals should be applied during training. CANOLA decouples the learning phase from the correction phase to ensure label updates are cautiously guided by a mature, converged model state.

- Overview of CANOLA: An iterative pipeline alternating between Noise Transition Matrix Construction (Phase 1) via asymmetric co-training and Corrupted Label Correction (Phase 2) using noise-aware learning and loss-triggered soft relabeling.
